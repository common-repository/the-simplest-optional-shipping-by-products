Disable shipping methods if a certain product is added to WooCommerce shopping cart.

== Description ==

#### Disable shipping methods by products

The Simplest: Optional Shipping by Products allows you to disable shipping methods in WooCommerce for each product if it's added to the shopping cart. E.g. if you have a very big product, you can disable "Free Shipping" for it and free shipping for the whole cart will be disabled if that item was added to the cart.

== Installation ==

To install this Plugin please follow:

* Please install the plugin in your Wordpress Dashboard under Plugins
* Activate the plugin
* You are ready to go!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin does not work! =

If the plugin does not work, please go to WordPress admin dashboard (wp-admin), then go to WooCommerce -> Shipping -> Shipping options and check "Debug mode". Refresh your cart and it should start working.
If it still does not work, it might be that you have other caching plugins installed (W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, etc.). You must deactivate these because this plugin is dynamic and recalculates shipping methods each time a product is added to a cart.
